## [0.7.0] - 2018-08-13

- Skill and talent tables have been redesigned to follow the "native" look of
  the hero table redesigned in v0.6.0.

  property in `hots.json`.

  and icons.

## [0.6.1] - 2018-08-03
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused hero tables to break in Firefox and Edge.


## [0.6.0] - 2018-08-03
### Added
- Use [`ajv`](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) to validate `hots.json` with a
  [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). The schema is available in
  [`docs/hots-schema.json`](docs/hots-schema.json).
- (Server) Added import script for hero data generated by
  [`heroes-parser`](https://github.com/joeistas/heroes-parser) (run with
  `--profile detailed` option)

### Changed
- Updated data with Heroes of the Storm v2.35.1 patch information.
- Hero tables have been redesigned. They are prettier, and now contain
  expandable/collapsible skill icons, and stat tables.
- Changed skill/talent cooldown icon to a more shiny one.
- Tooltips in the Select Hero/Skill/Talent dialog have been kicked up a notch
  with [`microtip`](https://github.com/ghosh/microtip/).
- Templates are properly minified with [`html-minifier`](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
- The Chrome extension now parses and decorates HotS data upon download. This
  makes the Select Hero/Skill/Talent dialog run slightly faster, at the cost of
  a small bump in the amount of local storage used (~200KB).
- Project layout change: Node.js scripts in `utils/` have been moved to
  `scripts/` and `api-server/`, to better distinguish their purpose.
- Multiple copies of `hots.json` and JS/CSS dependencies are now handled using
  hard links. Hard links can be installed using `npm run create-hard-links`
  (automatically called by `npm install`).

### Fixed
- Rectangular skill/talent icons are properly enlarged and clipped, both in the
   Select Hero/Skill/Talent dialog and in the inserted tables.


## [0.5.0] - 2018-07-13
### Added
- Added 'insert hero table' feature, generating a table of the hero's basic
  skills.
- Skill, talent, and hero tables can be expanded and collapsed with a click.
  Does not work in Internet Explorer and Edge (yet), which will always display
  an expanded table. See https://caniuse.com/#feat=details
- Inserted HTML tables can be quickly deleted in the editor with Ctrl + click.
- Added buttons that insert an entire row of talents (AKA talent groups).

### Changed
- Updated data with Heroes of the Storm v2.35.0 patch information.
- Inserted HTML table width has been slightly reduced.
- Inserted HTML tables are now `inline-block`, and can be mixed with text.
- Use CSS `background-image` instead of `<img>` to show icons. This is necessary
  to prevent launching a popup (enforced by Ruliweb) when clicking on an icon to
  expand/collapse a table.
- Added application version info at bottom of table.
- All inserted HTML now contain a Ruliweb-HotS version signature for debugging.
- Always run tests before building.
- Always generate a build after bumping version.
- Use [juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice) to generate inline CSS i
  templates.
- Hero basic stats are added in `docs/hots.json`, but not usable in the
  extension yet.

### Fixed
- (none)

  checking the option at the top of the dialog.

- Quests are properly hightlighted, with a distinct icon.
- Fancy animations when clicking on any icon in the dialog.

### Changed
- Use new icon set, provided by a kind passer-by.

- HotS version string is placed inside the skill/talent description cell.
